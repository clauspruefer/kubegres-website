                        <b>Kubegres</b> is a Kubernetes operator allowing to deploy one or many clusters of PostgreSql instances with data
                        replication and failover enabled out-of-the box. It brings simplicity when using PostgreSql considering how
                        complex managing stateful-set's life-cycle and data replication could be with Kubernetes.

                                It can manage one or many clusters of Postgres instances. Each cluster of Postgres instances
                                is created using a YAML of "kind: Kubegres". Each cluster is self-contained and is identified
                                by its unique name and namespace.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It creates a cluster of PostgreSql servers with

                                enabled: it creates a Primary PostgreSql pod and a number of Replica PostgreSql pods
                                and replicates primary's database in real-time to Replica pods.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It manages failover: if a Primary PostgreSql crashes, it automatically promotes a Replica
                                PostgreSql as a Primary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It has a data backup option allowing to dump PostgreSql data regularly in a given volume.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It provides a very simple YAML with properties specialised for PostgreSql.

                            <li>

                                and has been running in production.

                            <li>
                                It works with the <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">

                                PostgreSql libraries to manage replication and failover and it does not require a custom
                                Docker image with a set of third party libraries.

                    <h2><a id="kubegres_compared">How does Kubegres differentiate itself?</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Kubegres is fully integrated with Kubernetes' lifecycle as it runs as an operator written in Go.
                        It is minimalist in terms of codebase compared to other open-source Postgres operators.
                        It has the minimal and yet robust required features to manage a cluster of PostgreSql on Kubernetes.
                        We aim keeping this project small and simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>Among many reasons, there are 5 main ones why we recommend Kubegres:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Standard: to manage replications, failover and backup, Kubegres is 100% relying on the
                                PostgreSql standard libraries bundled in the
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">PostgreSql containers</a>.
                                It does not ship with any custom or third party libraries to manage those features.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Small learning curve: if you are already familiar with the standard PostgreSql libraries,
                                you can understand and admin Kubegres easily.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Secure: all other open source projects that we have evaluated do require their own
                                custom Docker containers which ship with custom libraries. And in order to reduce the attack
                                surface caused by additional dependencies, we have decided to only depend on the
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">PostgreSql containers</a>
                                created and maintained by the

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Portable: the approach above allows Kubegres to be compatible with any containers which
                                derive from those <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">PostgreSql containers</a>.

                                Pure Go: Kubegres was entirely written in Go and no additional languages were used
                                (e.g. Python, ...). And it uses the latest
